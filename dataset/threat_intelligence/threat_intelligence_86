As you might be aware, Microsoft releases its Security Intelligence Report (SIR) twice a year to help inform customers on changes in the threat landscape.  The report includes data from over a billion systems worldwide, regional analysis for 105 countries/regions and is designed to help customers manage risk within their environments. 
One of the things we thought we would do different for this release is give you a sneak peek look at what’s coming in volume 14 of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIRv14).  Check out my video below for some of the latest threat trends to emerge in the second half of 2012.
