It’s hard to believe RSA Conference USA 2014 is just a few weeks away.  Microsoft has been an active participant at RSA Conference for over a decade now and it’s great to see how far the awareness and importance of IT security has come. Over the past decade, attendance has grown dramatically, and this year’s conference is expected to be attended by more than 24,000 people.
At this year’s conference, in San Francisco, Microsoft is once again a sponsor. We have a very cool booth loaded with technology for attendees to check out. Scott Charney, Corporate Vice President, Trustworthy Computing, will deliver a keynote at the conference and other speakers from Microsoft will be delivering sessions throughout the week. 
On Wednesday, February 26, I will be delivering a speaker session titled “A Deep Dive into the Security Threat Landscape of the Middle East.”  This session will actually cover a wide set of locations including some in the Middle East as well as in Southwest Asia.  There has been continued high interest in this region of the world because of high profile cyber-attacks that have been perpetrated there over the past several years in addition to political, social and economic changes in the region. In this session, I will be discussing the threat landscape in numerous locations including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. I will also provide insights into how technical factors and socio-economic factors such as broadband penetration, regime stability, and GDP per capita have had an impact on malware infection rates in specific locations.  I will also discuss best practices and lessons learned from countries/regions with the least amount of malware infection rates.  For more details please check out my RSA podcast for a preview on what’s to come.   I look forward to the conference and hope to see you there. 
There are several other Microsoft speaker sessions at the conference too – here is a full list in chronological order.

You might have noticed that many of these sessions are early in the day. To make it easier for you to attend these morning sessions, I invite you to grab a free coffee from our espresso stand at the Microsoft booth.  You can also follow us on @MSFTSecurity for conference updates throughout the week.  
You might also be interested in Microsoft’s industry appreciation party? We are holding it at a different venue this year than the last couple of years…but you’ll have to go to the Microsoft booth at the conference to get all the details and an entry pass.

I hope to see you at the conference and the party!
