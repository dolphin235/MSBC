It’s been an exciting week here at RSA, attending sessions and catching up with fellow security colleagues over the past few days. Today at RSA, Mike Reavey, senior director Trustworthy Computing, and Elia Florio, software security engineer, Microsoft presented a compelling session on Microsoft’s response to the Flame malware. My colleague Tim Rains and I also presented the Security Intelligence Report (SIR) where we shared the latest global threat data trends and issues impacting millions of computers. We checked in with our guest reporter Brock Johnson who talked security with a few attendees. Watch our video to see a few RSA conference highlights.
