RSA Conference Session: Microsoft Security Intelligence ReportOn Thursday, February 28 at 10:40am PST, Jeff Jones and I will host a session in Room 310 (Session Code: DSP-R33) focused on global threat intelligence. We’ll discuss the latest changes in the security threat landscape, as well as share some recent research on socio-economic factors as they relate to malware infection rates.  Some of the topics we will cover include:

Vulnerabilities and Exploits – Trends in public vulnerability disclosures and exploit activity
Malware and Potentially Unwanted Software – Emerging threat families of malware and potentially unwanted software
Socio-Economic Factors and Malware Infection Rates – Drawing correlations between socio-economic factors such broadband penetration, regime stability and piracy against malware infections rates  

If you don’t get a chance to stop by our session, I encourage you to swing by the Microsoft booth #1616 to see all the great things we are showcasing this year.
I look forward to the conference and hope to see you there.
